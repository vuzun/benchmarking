# benchmarking

The purpose of these jupyter notebooks was to compare various machine learning methods on the same dataset.

Methods used were random forests, Gaussian processes, PCA, support vector machines and k-means.

The dataset was endometrial (UCEC) cancer's GISTIC scores obtained from [TCGA](http://firebrowse.org/)

Metrics used for comparison were time varying by feature size and accuracy for a specific feature size.
